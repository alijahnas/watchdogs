# Watch Dogs
Unnecessary but awesome command!!!

## About
This command calls dogs to watch over your computer.

Do you usually see your SSH connections being torn down without anyone doing anything about it? Don't you hate it?
Then you need watchdogs!

With this command, you will be able to call powerful and faithful dogs that watch over your connections so that nobody destroys them.

You can also call these dogs to watch over your computer when you have a coffee break.

Or if you need some company, you can call them in a corner window.

They are always there for you.

With this command, you can even just watch dogs if you like that. No judging.

Watchdogs: only the best dogs the computer world has ever seen.

All dogs are purebreds from: https://ascii.co.uk/art/dog

## Usage
You can add this project directory to your `PATH` (if you don't, you'll need to call the dogs with `./watchdogs`. This makes them sad):

`export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/this/project/directory`

To call the dogs:

```
watchdogs [-h] [-n n] [-d d] -- call dogs to watch over your computer (or just watch dogs if you like that)

where:
    -h  show this help text
    -n  set the delay between each dog call (default: 5)
    -d  if you only trust one dog, set it's number (default: random)
```
